/**
 * Sync OpenAPI specs into nb-sdk/specs/ as inputs to codegen.
 *
 * The generated typed clients are a pure function of these specs, so which bytes
 * land here decide what the SDK exposes. `spec-versions.json` pins that: it names
 * one released contract version per API, and CI fetches exactly those.
 *
 * Pinning is the whole point. This repo is public and cannot install the
 * private `@nasebanal/api-specs-*` packages, so it used to fetch
 * `<api>.yaml` — a moving target that follows whatever nb-api-specs last
 * published. On 2026-08-08 account 1.2.0 added `DELETE /api/v1/me`, the fetch
 * silently picked it up, `nb.account.me.get` vanished from the generated client,
 * and tests broke on a contract this repo never adopted — unnoticed for two days,
 * because nothing in a PR had changed.
 *
 * Source precedence:
 *   1. node_modules/@nasebanal/api-specs-<api>/spec.yaml  (installed package,
 *      if someone with registry access installed it)
 *   2. ../nb-api-specs/packages/<api>/spec.yaml           (sibling checkout —
 *      lets a spec change be tried here before it is published)
 *   3. ${NB_SPECS_BASE_URL}/<api>-<version>.yaml          (pinned public fetch)
 *
 * 1 and 2 are working copies and can be anything, so they are LOCAL ONLY —
 * under CI the pinned URL is the only source, and a mismatched local copy is
 * reported rather than silently used.
 *
 * To adopt a new contract, bump `spec-versions.json`. Renovate watches
 * `/specs/renovate/<api>.json` and opens that bump as a PR, so the adoption is
 * reviewed like any other dependency change.
